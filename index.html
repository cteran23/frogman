    <header>I Love Frogs</header>
    <p>The reason why I like frogs is because of the fact that they are all so incredibly diverse. You can find frogs in all sorts of enviroments from the most arid drylands to the tallest mountains. (I think)</p>
    <p>Another reason as to why I like frogs is because I grew up with them, sort of, I was always finding frogs outside of my house growing up and I always had a blast catching them and seeing them up close!</p>
    <p>This is my last paragraph that I am writing about these wonderful creatures, enjoy the photo!</p>
    <p>NEVERMIND! The best characteristics of a frog are the colors of it's skin and how high they can jump for their size. Also, they tast good. Don't judge me.</p>
